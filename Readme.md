## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Beniciusclaro/profit-calculation-api.git

2. Configure the database properties:

- in src/main/resources/application.yml or .properties


- or, if you want to run via Docker, simply use the command:: `docker-compose up -d --build` This will start a database inside a container.


- Then create a simple script to add a user to the database, for example:
```sql
    INSERT INTO users (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Edwardo');
```

3. Build and run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
4. The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`, and you can access the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html` for API documentation and testing.
